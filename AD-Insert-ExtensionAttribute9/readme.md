This script was made to insert the extension attribute 9 on all users informed in the file "userslist.csv"

![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) **How to use**

Open the file userslist.csv and insert for each line, a user and the extenstion attribute 9 that you would like to insert.
Run the script via powershell and it will create an external file called "report_updatedate.csv".

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) **Important**

This script is presented as is. WYSIWYG :punch:
